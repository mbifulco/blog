## Semantic HTML makes your sites better

Semantic HTML is important because it helps improve the accessibility of a web page and makes the code more readable. Semantic elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a way that is easy for both humans and machines to understand.

Search engines can more easily parse and understand semantic HTML, [which can help improve your website's SEO](https://developers.google.com/style/semantic-tagging). Semantic HTML uses tags to describe the meaning of content on a page, rather than just its presentation. This can help search engines better understand the content of a page and index it appropriately.

### Using h2 as a subtitle for an h1 is incorrect

According to the [html spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#heading-content-2), `h1` through `h6` tags are meant to indicate the structure of a document. In other words, each page should have at most 1 `<h1>` tag, and `<h2>` elements should be _sub-sections_ of that `h1` - not additional descriptions for it.

This [warning from the HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content) does a great job of explaining it:

> For example, the following snippet, intended to represent the heading of a corporate site, is non-conforming because the second line is not intended to be a heading of a subsection, but merely a subheading or subtitle (a subordinate heading for the same section).
>
> ```html
> <body>
>   <h1>ACME Corporation</h1>
>   <h2>The leaders in arbitrary fast delivery since 1920</h2>
>   ...
> </body>
> ```

(07/05/2022) As of the time of this writing, whatwg goes on to recommend use of `hgroup` in its solution. [According to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hgroup#usage_notes), hgroup should not be used, as it is not supported by assistive technologies needed for accesible reading of HTML sites.

## Use this code to add subtitles to headings

The correct semantic structure of HTML for a heading with a subtitle is straightforward - nest your `<h1>`, etc with in a `<header>` tag, and include a `<p>` tag with an appropriate class name as a sibling to that `h1`:

```html
<header>
  <h1>How to bootstrap a product as a solo founder</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Important lessongs learned from building 10 products on my own in 2 years
  </p>
</header>
```

For more details on this, check out [MDN docs on the header tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header), and their [semantics section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics).

### üö® UPDATE: I was wrong! üö®

The first version of this article was wrong! I previously recommended using the `<hgroup>` tag as per the whatwg spec, but I was corrected by [@AnalyticsEqv](https://twitter.com/AnalyticsEqv) on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    MDN specifically recommends against &lt;hgroup&gt; because assistive
    technologies don&#39;t support it.
  </p>

Thanks for the correction! I definitely get things wrong sometimes, and I'm always happy to correct myself when appropriate.
