## Notes about today's Livecoding stream
This is a YouTube Livestream, where I'll be working on integrating Resend Broadcasts into my next.js site to use for sending newsletters. Resend released a new set of features this week that makes it easier to send mail to large audiences.

I'll be building with:

- Resend
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Vercel
- Tailwind CSS

With Substack recently catching headlines for their boneheaded content moderation policies, lots of creators and developers have been looking at other tools for managing their mailing lists. Between Beehiiv, ConvertKit, Ghost, Mailchimp, and some of the other usual suspects, there are many options to choose from.

Let's take a look at Resend's new API to see how it works, and if it's a good fit for my workflow!
