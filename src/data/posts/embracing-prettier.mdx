[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is "an opinionated code formatter", built to fit into your developer workflow. It's been out in the world for quite a while now, but until today, I had never successfully used it in any project I worked on. In truth, there's a few reasons for this:

1. I was really used to (and really happy with) using [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) for all of my projects. Across the board, I'd configured every node/react/js-based project to use the same airbnb config, and had a functional workflow for ensuring code quality at some level through those lint checks.  
1. I was too busy to switch. This is a bit of a bullshit answer, since one of prettier's biggest advertised features is its lightweight setup. That's not to mention the amount of time that prettier _should_ save me once in use. A bad excuse.  
1. **I could never get it to work(!)** So - despite being adept at reading through docs, every single time I started down the path of setting up prettier on a project, I couldn't get it to work. Despite my peers shouting from the rooftops about how deliciously sublime prettier makes the development workflow, it seemed like a permanent impasse.

## So what was the problem, then?

Well, it all came down to a formatting issue. The header image for this article tells the story: every time I installed prettier, when I triggered formatting with Visual Studio Code's `formatOnSave` setting, my React/jsx components would get scrambled. After some squinting, it appears that something was telling my IDE to treat these jsx files as pure Javascript, where `<` means "less than", and shouldn't ever be treated as the start of a component `<tag>`.

## The Fix

In my case, it came down to a conflicting extension for Visual Studio Code. It turns out that the [beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) plugin takes precedence over Prettier in its default configuration. After some plucking around, I determined that if I _disable_ Beautify in the workspace where I'm using prettier, everything just suddenly... works. 😍

In my case, that was it! Prettier is now working as advertised.

The jury's still out on whether prettier is life-changing for me, but it's working, at the very least. My next step was to jump into `.prettierrc`, and override _just a few_ settings:

```js
    {
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "semi": false,
      "singleQuote": true,
      "jsxSingleQuote": false,
      "tabWidth": 2
    }
```

_(note: this is my first time writing JavaScript without semicolons. I'm really breaking the rules now!)_
