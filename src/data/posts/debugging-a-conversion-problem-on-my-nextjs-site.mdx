## Summary

I've been experiencing a problem with my personal website, mikebifulco.com, where my newsletter sign-ups have mysteriously plummeted. In this video, I take you through the process of diagnosing and debugging this issue using Posthog, a powerful product analytics tool.

We'll start by taking a look at the site, identifying potential problem areas, and then diving into the code. I'll show you how I implement Posthog to track user interactions and gather valuable insights. We'll explore how to handle form submissions, track events, and use Posthog’s features to pinpoint what's going wrong.

Throughout the video, I'll share my thought process, hypotheses, and the steps I take to experiment and test different solutions. If you've ever had a non-bug issue in production, this video is for you. Let's get to the bottom of this conversion rate mystery together!

You might be interested in this video if you want to learn about debugging and optimizing website performance, especially using tools like Posthog. Relevant technologies and subject areas include React, Next.js, form handling, product analytics, serverless functions, and conversion rate optimization.
