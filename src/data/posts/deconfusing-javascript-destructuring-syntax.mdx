[Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax in es6 (or es2015, etc) JavaScript is a wonderfully useful bit of the language.  It allows you to extract values from an `Object` and assign them to a new variable in one statement.  If you've not come across destructuring before, a fairly basic case looks like this:

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'Mike Bifulco',
  height: 556,
  fears: ['heights', 'fire'],
};
const { name } = person;
console.log(name); // this will print 'Mike Bifulco'
```

So - what's happening here is pretty simple.  We are creating a `const` called `name`, and filling it with the value found in `person.name` . This is accomplished using the bracket structure to the left of the `=`.

(If you haven't seen or used this before, it can definitely be confusing.  Don't fault yourself for that - it'll become second-nature before long.)

There's are many other useful things you can do by way of destructuring.  For me, the most common among them are:

## Renaming

If you want to pluck a value from within an object, but also need to rename it (for purposes of code readability, perhaps), you can do so in one line:

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'Mike Bifulco',
  height: 556,
  fears: ['heights', 'fire'],
};

const { height: currentHeight } = person;

console.log(currentHeight); // 556
console.log(height); // undefined!
```

Just like that, we've assigned `person.height` to `currentHeight` in one line.  Sweet!

## Extracting

You can extract one value from an object, and create another variable with everything else, you can do that, too:

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'Mike Bifulco',
  height: 556,
  fears: ['heights', 'fire'],
};

const { fears, ...fearlessPerson } = person;

console.log(fearlessPerson.fears); // undefined!
console.log(fears[0]); // heights
```

This is a combination of destructuring syntax and the spread operator (`...` ). Very handy!

## Hard mode: complex destructuring

So both extracting and renaming things with destructuring are fairly straightforward.  I've been using both of those tricks comfortably for a while now.  In the past few months, I've been poking around with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) for a few different projects (including my own website).  When I was starting to customize and implement my own Gatsby theme, I started to see some _really_ complex looking destructuring syntax, used to pull nested values from GraphQL queries throughout the site.

I was really thrown - at first glance, it's not obvious what's going on.  Let's take a look at an example, pulled from a React component used to render a single page in a Gatsby theme:

```jsx
const singlePage = ({
  data,
  location,
  pageContext: { nextPagePath, previousPagePath },
}) => {
  return <p>...react component markup</p>;
};
```

There's a combination of things happening in the definition of the `singlePage` React component.  Let's look at just that destructure, and simplify it a bit:

```jsx
const {
  data,
  location,
  pageContext: { nextPagePath, previousPagePath },
} = props;
```

It took some staring, and some playing around to figure out what was being accomplished here, so let's run through it step by step:

1.  The right side of this `const` is `= props` which tells us that all of these values are being destructured from an object called `props` .
2.  The first two values, `data` and `location` make good sense - they look just like the examples above.  This line will create a `const` from each of those two paths in the `props` object.
3.  `pageContext` is where things get interesting -  this is _another_ destructuring.  Somewhat confusingly, the values that are being pulled from `props` here are `nextPagePath` and `previousPagePath` . There is no variable being created for `pageContext` .

If that description didn't help - I don't blame you.  It really took some practice for me to understand what's going on.  I'm not even sure I would recommend using this syntax - it's not particularly easy to read, especially when tools like `prettier` squish it onto fewer lines.

With that said, it seems to be the way-to-go when pulling data from GraphQL queries on Gatsby (and likely elsewhere). If you're going to be working in that world, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with what's going on here.

## Homework

I think the best way to get used to this syntax is just play around with it yourself.  I've created a JSBin which you can use to experiment a bit.  I'd love to hear how you do with it! [Check it out here](https://jsbin.com/kifizij/2/edit?js,console).

Some challenges for you:

- Rename the variable `displayName` to `currentUserName`
- Extract `editedBy` into its own variable
- Create an object called `meta` which contains everything in `directions` except for the `contactNumber`

## Wrapping up

I'd love to hear how you fare with this - I found myself writing this post as a matter of self-help.  Often times these things won't be made concrete until I practice in isolation for a while.  What creative uses do you have for destructuring? Did I get anything wrong here? Let's talk about it.
