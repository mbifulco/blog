In this video, I discuss my recent efforts to improve the product analytics experience on my website. Over the past two weeks, I addressed a sign-up issue by switching to a new email service and implementing AB testing on my newsletter forms. I analyzed the results, but discovered a bug that prevented complete data collection. I walk through identifying the problem, show the fixes I made, and reset the experiment to gather accurate data. I also encourage viewers to check out the open-source code for my site and invite feedback and questions.
