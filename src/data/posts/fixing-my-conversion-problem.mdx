## Summary

In part two of my adventure with product analytics, I tackle a significant drop in my newsletter subscribers. Join me as I dive into the data using PostHog, identify and fix critical errors, and ultimately switch from ConvertKit to Resend – a more developer-friendly email platform.

Along the way, I'll show you how I integrated tRPC into my Next.js site for a type-safe API, created hooks for better data management, and set use posthog to chase down the root of the bug.

Whether you're a startup founder or an indie hacker, you'll find valuable insights to improve your product. Plus, transparency is key – this video is sponsored by PostHog, but all opinions are genuinely mine. Let's build something great together!
