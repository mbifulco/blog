## We did it!

You all are amazing.  Last week I posted about [some stickers I designed](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/egg-them-all) and had put up for sale to benefit victims of the shooting in Christchurch, NZ.  They sold out far, _far_ more quickly than I ever would have guessed.  Having never done this before, I ordered a modest print run.  The next time I do something like this (and there _will_ be a next time), I'll double the order, at the very least.

This morning I made a donation to the [LaunchGood campaign](https://www.launchgood.com/campaign/support_for_the_families__victims_of_the_new_zealand_mosque_shootings), thanks to all of you:

It's a drop in a (thankfully) much larger bucket, but having some positive impact in what was starting to feel like a hopeless, dark time really means a lot to me.

Thank you all - keep making the world a better place. ❤️
