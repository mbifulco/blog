The [Orton Effect](https://www.capturelandscapes.com/orton-effect-explained/) is a photography technique that involves taking two pictures of the same scene, one with a long exposure and one with a shorter exposure, and then combining them. The result is an image that has both the sharpness of the long exposure and the detail of the shorter exposure. While it's not an exact replica, we can simulate a phoo filter for the Orton Effect using CSS and React.

## Emulating the Orton Effect in CSS

To emulate the Orton Effect in CSS, we need to layer 2 copies of the same image on top of one other. To accomplish that, we'll nest them under a single parent - in this case, the [`figure` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/html/element/figure). Note that for the second image, we set [`aria-hidden=true`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden), so that people using Screen Readers. won't encounter the repeated image element. You can read more about that and other accessibility features of HTML on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden).

```html
<figure class="orton-effect">
  <img
    src="https://source.unsplash.com/tRDGs9utMUo/1600x900"
    alt="A man in the crosswalk on a city street"
  />
  <img
    src="https://source.unsplash.com/tRDGs9utMUo/1600x900"
    aria-hidden="true"
  />
</figure>
```

Next, we'll use a CSS rule to apply some styles to the _first_ of the two images (in HTML-speak, that's the one on top).

```css
figure.orton-effect img:first-of-type {
  position: absolute;
  mix-blend-mode: lighten;
  filter: blur(50px);
  opacity: 50%;
}
```

We're setting `position: absolute;` to layer this image on top of its sibling within the `<figure>` element. The remaining 3 lines of CSS set the top image to use the `lighten` blend mode, apply a gaussian blur using `filter`, and make the top image partly translucent by way of the `opacity` CSS property.

This creates a hazy, glassy effect:

### Before:

<img
  src="https://source.unsplash.com/tRDGs9utMUo/1600x900"
  alt="A man in the crosswalk on a city street"
/>

### After:

<OrtonEffectImage
  src={'https://source.unsplash.com/tRDGs9utMUo/1600x900'}
  alt="A man in the crosswalk on a city street"
  blurRadius={50}
  opacity={50}
/>

It's subtle - but it is there, adding just a slight haze over the light parts of the photo, like a morning fog settling in over a dreamscape.

## The Orton Effect in React

To apply this to an adjustable React Component, we'll use CSS-in-JS to make blur and opacity dynamic. There's many ways to get this done, of course, so you may prefer a different approach. This is what a simple react component for this layout might look like:

```jsx
const OrtonEffectImage = ({ alt, blurRadius, opacity, src }) => {
  return (
    <figure>
      <img
        src={src}
        alt={alt}
        style={{
          mixBlendMode: 'lighten',
          filter: `blur(${blurRadius}px)`,
          opacity: `${opacity}%`,
          position: 'absolute',
        }}
      />
      <img src={src} ariaHidden />
    </figure>
  );
};
```

This gives us a reusable component that just needs a few parameters passed in - for example:

```jsx
<OrtonEffectImage
  src={'https://source.unsplash.com/vZlTg_McCDo/1600x900'}
  alt="A snowy landscape"
  blurRadius={30}
  opacity={70}
/>
```

Note that a few things have changed here - we're no longer using a named CSS class (`.orton-image`) to select and modify images via CSS. The CSS is now specified on the `img` tag itself, and because it is passed in via `style` prop, it is a JavaScript Object -- so keywords have gone from skewer-case to camelCase, and there's commas where we once had semicolons. Additionally, we're using ES6 String templates to interpolate style rules from the opacity and blur radiuses passed in.

There's some improvement to be done from here - you should do some error checking to make sure that opacity stays between 0 and 100%, and that the blur radius is a positive integer. It's also a good idea to provide some sensible fallback values for those options, in case they're not provided. I'll leave that up to you to implement.

## The Orton Effect in Action

Below you will see the Orton Effect applied to a handful of other images from Unsplash.

I've taken the above example a little further, and made blur and opacity adjustable, so that you can see how each parameter changes the image effect.

I've found that an opacity of somewhere between 25 and 50% and tends to create a nice, subtle effect. The "right" blur radius is a bit more dependent on the specific image.

<OrtonEffectImage
