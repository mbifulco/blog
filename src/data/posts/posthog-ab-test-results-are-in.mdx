In this video from my Tiny Improvements series, I'm diving into product analytics to improve newsletter signups on my personal site. Join me as I share my engineering process, from discovering a bug with my old provider to setting up an A/B test with PostHog to find the best-performing newsletter signup form. Despite fewer-than-hoped signups, I've gathered key insights to refine my strategy. Plus, a sneak peek into my next steps, like redesigning the signup popup and enhancing site SEO. If you're a startup founder or indie hacker, you’ll find plenty of actionable tips here!
