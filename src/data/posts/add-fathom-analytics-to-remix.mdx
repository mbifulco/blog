Building a website using the Remix.run web app framework? This tutorial will teach you how to add privacy-first analytics to your Remix site with Fathom.

## How to set up Fathom on your Remix site

1. Sign into your account with [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/login), and create a new site.
2. Open the settings for that site, and look for _Script settings_. Hit the clipboard icon to copy the Script tag for your site.

     alt="Script settings for one of my sites on Fathom's dashboard"
     caption="You site's embed code will be on the script settings page. Hit the clipboard button to copy the code"
   />

3. Open up your Remix site in your IDE of choice. open `root.tsx` (or `root.jsx` if you're using JavaScript instead of TypeScript), and paste your embed code right before the `<Script />` tag:

```jsx
return (
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <Meta />
      <Links />
    </head>
    <body>
      <Layout>
        <Outlet />
      </Layout>
      <ScrollRestoration />

      <script
        src="https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js"
        data-site="TRSSCIOR"
        defer
      />
      <Scripts />
      <LiveReload />
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

<small>

_Note: ‚òùüèΩ I've edited the `<script>` tag here to be self closing, rather than having `<script></script>`. It should work either way._

</small>

4. Start your site with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` and visit any page (you may have to hit reload if you had the page open already). You should see this reflected in your fathom dashboard in real time!

     alt="You'll know it's working when you see a live visitor on your fathom dashboard"
     caption="You'll know it's working when you see a live visitor on your fathom dashboard"
   />
