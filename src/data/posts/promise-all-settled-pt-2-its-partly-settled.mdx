This is a follow-up to my [first post](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/solve-all-your-problems-with-promise-allsettled) on the upcoming `Promise.allSettled()` function, coming soon to a node application near you.

Earlier today I was greeted by a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mbifulco/blog/pull/14) on my first post from GitHub user `@j-f1`.

It turns out there _is_ a handy way to add `Promise.allSettled()` to your apps _right now!_ üéâ. ¬†It's fiendishly simple to use, too.

## **The core-js npm package**

That's right - [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js). ¬†From their `README.md`, it is exactly what it sounds like:

<Aside>

It is a polyfill of the JavaScript standard library, which supports:

- The latest ECMAScript standard.
- ECMAScript standard library proposals.
- Some WHATWG / W3C standards (cross-platform or closely related ECMAScript).

It is maximally modular: you can easily choose to load only the features you will be using.  
 It can be used without polluting the global namespace.  
 It is [tightly integrated with `babel`: this allows many optimizations of `core-js` import.](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2019-03-19-core-js-3-babel-and-a-look-into-the-future.md#Babel)

[Looking further down in the readme](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2019-03-19-core-js-3-babel-and-a-look-into-the-future.md#Babel), there's a list of supported features in the polyfill:

Well hot damn! That'll do it!

## **How to use core-js**

As `@j-f1` indicated, in any project that uses `babel` as a transpiler, all you need to do is add core-js to your project, and include it at your app's entry point:

First, add the dependency to your project

```bash
    > yarn add core-js
```

Then, at your app's entry point (usually something like `index.js`, or `app.js` in the root of your project):

```js
import 'core-js';
```

or, if you want to include _just_ the `Promise.allSettled()` polyfill, and nothing else, use:

```js
import 'core-js/proposals/promise-all-settled';
```

That's it! üçª
