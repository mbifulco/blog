So, like all good things, the idea for this post comes from a tweet:

<Twitter tweetLink="irreverentmike/status/1141169316273897536" />

This is something I've been ruminating on for a bit.  I've even tried to build it - a few times! I keep starting in on the work and getting lost in the millions of directions I could take it. 

Here's what I'd like: When I publish a new post to [my gatsby site](https://mikebifulco.com) (you're on it now!), I'd like for that post to appear on [dev.to](https://dev.to) automatically.

## It should:

- recreate my post verbatim, from its original markdown source
- use the `canonical_url` frontmatter field to make sure I retain SEO goodness on my post
- happen without my intervention
- be agnostic of where my posts are coming from.  I use [takeshape.io](https://takeshape.io) as a headless CMS for my site, so my individual posts aren't in source control
- only take posts from my `master` branch, since I use feature branches for draft posts from time to time
- use the [dev.to API](https://dev.to/api), of course

## Nice to have:

- maybe posts should be set to `published: false` at first, so I can preview/review/update them as needed for dev.to?

## Possible approaches for this:

1. Tap into GitHub's webhooks somehow, and fire off a post here 
1. Come from a job kicked off after CI, maybe? I use CircleCI, but would like this feature to be fairly implementation agnostic.
1. Use a [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/)?
1. ...or a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/mbifulco/thepraticaldev-crosspost-action)?
1. Perhaps just a lamba function deployed to AWS or [Netlify Functions](https://functions.netlify.com/).

So - here's where I ask for your help.  Surely there's a simple approach here I haven't thought of, or maybe it's a matter of collecting a few scenarios and building something based on 80/20.

What else am I missing here? I'd love your help.  What use cases would you have for a cross-poster from your gatsby site? How would you implement it? How can we help each other?
