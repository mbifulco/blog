## The Big Idea

When you carve out focused time for your work, you're making a statement. This week, let's harness that power and explore how to stay on task with purpose.

## Focus Mode for the Defiant

Founders who actually _build_ things are a special type. You are making a statement: you've found a problem worth solving, and you're using some of your limited time on this earth to solve it.

Everyone's time is limited, and the act of building something is a display of your priorities -- so don't waste it on distractions.

When you focus your time and energy on creating, you're asserting your free will in the most powerful way possible. This week, let's talk about how to stay on task and bring your boldest ideas to life.

Let's talk about _focus mode._

## Practical Tips for focusing

A funny thing about my role at [Craftwork](https://craftwork.com) is that the more we grow, the _less_ time I have to do "typical" work - my days lately are spent focused on strategy, hiring, scaling, and unblocking my teammates.

This means I get precious little time to _write code_ - which makes it all the more important that I make the most of the time I do have.

I use a few strategies to carve out focus time, to eliminate distractions, and to make use of the limited time I have to be productive each day.

- **Scheduling Focus Blocks:** I set aside 90-180 minute blocks each week for deep work. These uninterrupted periods are when I do my best thinking.
- **Notification Detox:** I turn off non-essential notifications -- all the time, 24/7. This helps me stay in control of my time and attention. Rather than get sidetracked by an email coming in, I check email when it's productive for _me_ to do so.
- **Do Not Disturb Mode:** To further manage notifications, I flip on _Do not Disturb_ on my laptop and my phone - this further cinches down notifications, and helps me stay focused. I usually do this with a set end time, so that I can focus on the task at hand.
- **A literal, physical timer:** When working through tasks that are mentally taxing, I use a minimalist desk timer from [TIME TIMER](https://amzn.to/3PPRKBT) as a visual reminder to keep me on track.

## The Importance of Focus

It is _extremely_ easy to waste away your days with notifications, social media apps, and other distractions. Founders who _get things done_ are the ones who have learned to focus. It is a skill, and it requires practice.

Moving the needle every day is the difference between a _wantrepreneur_ and a _founder_.

Don't let distractions get in the way of your focus.

As a founder, your inbox is chaos-but it doesn't have to be. Superhuman cuts through the noise, prioritizes what matters, and drafts replies before you even open a message. Every action takes seconds, not minutes.

Start 2025 with clarity, focus, and 4+ hours saved every week. **Your first month is free.** What's stopping you?
