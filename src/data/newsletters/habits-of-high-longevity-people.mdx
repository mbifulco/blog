## The Big Idea

What if sleeping a little better, moving a little more, and finding a sense of purpose could measurably change your life?

Not as a vibe. As a fact supported by decades of research.

## How to live a long, happy life

When researchers study people who live the longest, most fulfilling lives, they don't find hacks or extreme discipline. They find the same small behaviors repeated quietly over time.

Thankfully, there's no magic to it. The behaviors that have emerged are simple and accessible, and -- apparently -- they work. If you're looking for a "one weird trick" panacea, you won't find it here. The fact of the matter is that when you repeat a few seemingly small behaviors over and over again, they start to add up.


## Why tiny beats dramatic

Big changes fail because they ask too much, too fast. Small habits succeed because they're easy to repeat. I love that this is backed by actual, real Behavioral science, too - the data shows that consistency is better than intensity.

A tiny habit rarely feels life-changing in the moment. But repeated often enough, it changes what a normal day looks like. Enough normal days, and the long arc follows.

## The same habits, over and over again

Across longevity research, the same few habits appear again and again:

- **Adequate rest:** Roughly seven to eight hours of quality sleep, consistently.

- **Eating lots of plants:** Meals centered on vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, with moderate portions.

- **Daily, natural movement:** Low-impact movement woven into everyday life.

- **Strong social connection:** Regular time with friends, family, or community. It's a stronger predictor of happiness than wealth.

- **A sense of purpose and optimism:** Feeling useful, connected, and oriented toward something that matters.

Over the course of a lifetime, these tiny shifts in mindset and behavior can have a massive impact on you. And to me, at least, no single one of these sounds particularly difficult to maintain.

## Little changes that snuck up on me.

For years, I have been adopting little, bitty morsels of self-improvement. They help me to grow personally, stay balanced, and manage stress.

When I started managing a team at Google during the pandemic, I adopted a [simple morning ritual](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter/continuous-self-improvement). I do five minutes of journaling, and five minutes of meditation. Nothing elaborate. That small routine helped me manage stress and show up more consistently for my team.

I've also been doing daily language learning for years. Just a few minutes a day stretches a different part of my brain, and has satisfied my personal desire to learn something new. Even better, I'm at least _conversational_ in Spanish, and I can read a surprising amount of Japanese by now!

## The Long View

Longevity and happiness are on my mind a lot lately - I've been thinking about shaping the long arc of my life's story. I want to be as happy as possible for the small amount of time I have on earth. It's as easy as that!

I find it very encouraging that there is research behind these ideas... If small habits can reliably improve a day, it's not much of a leap to believe they can shape decades too.

As the new year approaches, maybe it's worth a complete shift in perspective: You don't need a hard reset. Instead, maybe adopt a habit that's easy enough to keep, even on bad days.

Then, maybe: another one.

## My Question for You

**When you try to build new habits, what actually works for you? How do you keep yourself honest once the motivation fades?**

Hit reply and tell me. I read every response, and I'm genuinely curious.

Ready to go all-in on longevity, habits, and happiness? Here are some of the resources I found myself reading that really grabbed my attention.

- [A Harvard Study of Adult Development](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life) shows that close relationships and social connection are stronger predictors of long, healthy lives than wealth, fame, or status.
- [Blue Zones and the Power 9 Principles](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125071/) is a study on communities where people live past 100 most often. It identifies common lifestyle traits tied to longevity, like natural movement, purpose, and plant-forward diets.
