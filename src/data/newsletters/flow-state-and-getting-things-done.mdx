## The Big Idea

Flow state is a mental space where deep focus and creativity come together, allowing you to work more effectively and productively.

---

If you've ever found yourself _so focused_ on a task that you're nearly blind to the world around you, you have very likely experienced _flow state_.

First defined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, _flow state_ is a state of mind where you're so absorbed in an activity that you lose track of time and external distractions. It's a delicate blend of focus, creativity, and energy that allows you to get lost in your work. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)))

Flow state can make you feel _superhuman_. It's a state where focus, motivation, and productivity are at their peak.

If you've felt it, you know what I'm talking about.

## Why flow state is important

Engineering and product design are complex tasks, which are often best done without distraction. When I'm untangling a particularly complex bug or building a new feature, I am far more likely to be successful if I can focus on the task at hand.

For me at least, this doesn't always mean a silent, vacant room. I've found that I can get into a flow state in a busy coffee shop, while walking around the city, or at my desk in the office in the mdidle of a workday

## How I find flow state

Finding your flow state is one of those things where you need to know yourself and your brain a bit. Even for me, it varies a bit day to day: some days I work best from the comfort of my kitchen, or the counter at my local espresso bar, and other days I do best at my desk in the office, with two monitors and a good pair of headphones on.

Regardless of _where_ I am, there are a few things I do to help me get into a flow state:

1. Turn off notifications, and don't look at my phone
2. Close any apps or tabs that might distract me
3. Have a clear, specific task in mind

## Tips for getting in the zone

### Pomodoro is Italian for tomato

The _pomodoro technique_ is simple: set a timer for 25 minutes, work until it rings, then take a 5-minute break. This method can effectively help you enter a flow state.

I learned this from a teammate at Google, who tracked his productivity with 🍅 emojis - each representing a pomodoro.

(Thanks for the inspiration, [Proppy](https://bsky.app/profile/proppy.bsky.social)!)

Many productivity apps include a pomodoro timer, like Logseq and Raycast. If you prefer a physical metaphor, you might like the [minimalist modern timer](https://amzn.to/4fmrhX1) above, which I recently snapped up for a few bucks on Amazon.


### Be selfish with your calendar

I regularly use Google Calendar's Focus Time feature to block off 90-min blocks of time to get things done. This gives me a guaranteed block of productive time, regardless of which meetings get added to my day. It's something I encourage my teammates to do, and if you've never tried it, I highly recommend it.

### Your phone can help

Whether you use an iPhone or an Android, your phone has support for Focus Modes. These are a great way to block out distractions and get into a flow state. If you haven't tried them before, here's a quick guide for each: [iPhone](https://www.theverge.com/23355242/ios-16-focus-modes-how-to-apple-iphone), [Android](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-focus-mode-in-android-13).

If you're not a fan of focus mode, Do Not Disturb is a very effective cudgel for blocking out distractions.

Side note: did you know that iOS has a feature that will [play calming nature sounds](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109346) called _Background Sounds_?

### Communicate your availability

As always, communication is foundational to working with others. Tell your teammates about focus time (make it public on your calendar), let them know you're blocking off time to get work done, and be diligent about following up on messages that you missed during your focus time.
