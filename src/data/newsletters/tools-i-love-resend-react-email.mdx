## The Big Idea

The best developer tools make you faster and make you look good. Resend does both - for email, of all things.

## Let's talk about tools

I've had a few conversations lately with other founders and indie hackers about the stack behind my site—and one thing always comes up: how I send emails.

To be clear: **this isn't a sponsored post**. Nobody paid me to write this. I just really like using Resend, and I think more developers should know it exists.

As a startup founder, every one of my days is time-constrained. I’ve always got too much to do, and too little time to do it. That’s why I’m a sucker for tools that do two things at once: save me time and help me look polished.

[Resend](https://resend.com) is one of those rare tools. It makes sending beautiful, functional emails from your app almost feel… fun? Which, if you’ve ever wrestled with email templates, you’ll know is not a word we usually associate with this stuff.

## Why the heck is email so hard?

If you've never tried designing email, it sounds simple—just HTML and CSS, right?

Not quite.

Email clients (Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook) all render things differently. There’s no real standard, and the rules are weird and inconsistent.

Why? Because email is ancient tech. Email has been morphing and evolving since the 1980s - and once you start trying to send nice-looking emails, you will feel it.

### Resend to the rescue

I use Resend to send my newsletter, as well as transactional emails -- like the confirmation message that new subscribers get. I designed my email templates in Figma like I would any other interface, and use Resend's open source [React Email](https://react.email/) library to bring it to life in code.

I cannot overstate how difficult this process _used_ to be. That 👆🏾 is an extremely ambitious email format to build from scratch.

In the new world of Resend, it's a familiar pattern:

The code to ship it off to your inbox isn't bad either:

```tsx
const WelcomeMessage = <WelcomeEmail firstName={firstName} />;
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: '💌 Tiny Improvements <hello@mikebifulco.com>',
  to: [email],
  subject: "Subscription confirmed. I'm so glad you're here!",
  react: WelcomeMessage,
  text: await render(WelcomeMessage, { plainText: true }),
});
```

My next.js site is also set up to listen to a few webhooks from Resend, where I can track things like subscription events, opens, unsubscribes, and more.

There's more to it than that, and if you're interested in the nitty-gritty, my site's source code is [available on GitHub for you to check out](https://github.com/mbifulco/blog).

## What tools make you look good?

Tips, tricks, and recommendations from my dev-pals is something that I've always loved. When I get around to it, I've got a whole list of recommendations that I'm planning to share -- like the shortcuts I find most helpful with [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), and the process I'm using to make Cursor smarter while I code.

I'm really keen to hear from you.

What tools make you look good? What saves you time and makes your life easier? Hit reply and send me a note. I'm all ears!

## Some links to keep your brain wrinkling

I'll cop to it: I haven't had a lot of time for things other than work lately. When I have had some time to relax, these videos have stood out from the pack.

-  [Frozen orange juice is actually super weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wSQ9Zk_9gQ) is a fascinating video essay from Phil Edwards about the surprising economics of something that seems so simple.
- [How do we feel the wind?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0_W4SWHeWY) - part of Complexly's recent video series where people ask Hank Green... well, anything. In this edition, musical supergenuis Jacob Collier does the asking. Really, really interesting to see to _absolutely brilliant_ people interact so candidly.
