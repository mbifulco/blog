## The Big Idea

Every message is a moment of influence. Make the nudge helpful and you'll create power users and build loyalty.

## What is Nudge Theory?

Nudge Theory is a framework for guiding user behavior through subtle, persuasive techniques. It is based on the idea that people are more likely to change their behavior if they are given a choice that is easy to make.

In other words, a little proactive messaging goes a long way.

### Why Nudge Theory Matters

There's a little bit of behavioral science at play when a product uses thoughtful nudges in its onboarding. Research in behavioral economics shows that small, well-timed cues can help people adopt new habits and tools more easily. In other words, a gentle nudge at the right moment can make all the difference.

## A concrete example: Blacksmith

That's exactly what we found with [Blacksmith](https://blacksmith.sh?utm_source=tinyimprovements&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nudge-theory-for-guiding-user-behavior). It promised to speed up our CI workflows for less cost, something my team at [Craftwork](https://craftwork.com) would benefit from immensely.

Our initial onboarding was smooth - the software generated a PR to swap our CI workflows onto their infratstructure. The speed boost was immediate, and life-changing for my team.

### Thoughtful Nudges in Action

What really impressed me was what happened a day later - each day, I would receive an email with a new tip, rooted in behavioral insights, to guide us step-by-step on how to get the most value from Blacksmith.

From the first message, Blacksmith gently introduced us to one feature at a time. Each day, a new tip arrived - ensuring that the game-changing features the Blacksmith team built didn't get lost in my haste to try the product out on Day 1.

They could have spend a lot of time developing a slick, highly-interactive onboarding wizard -- which I almost certainly would have skipped. Instead, a slick little drip campaign offered even more value for my team.

You better believe I tried each one.

## Use these powers for good

- The Wikipedia entry for [Nudge Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) is a great primer - it may sound wishy-washy, but this is real behavioral science.
- Nudge Theory is, of course, a two-sided coin - there's a great paper on [ethical concerns with nudging](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10434631231155005) that is worth a read.

So, how will you turn this knowledge into action? Whether you're building a product or trying to influence people to be better neighbors, there is a whole lot of power in the way you reach people with your messaging.
