## The big idea

In the early days of building a product, focus on building strong connections with small group of people to solicit meaningful feedback and drive network effect growth.

## Your product's success relies on trust

When building something new, it's natural to set your sights on hitting massive growth numbers.

[Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) suggests that sustainable growth starts smaller than you might think - with a close-knit, trusted network. This social theory, from British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, suggests that we can maintain stable social relationships with around 150 people at most.

But within that 150, there's almost always a much smaller core audience that truly drive connection, influence, and impact.

In the early stages of building a product or service, these core people are your foundation. They're the first to test, trust, and tell others about what you're doing. Nurturing this group can create a network effect that sets you up for growth.

## What it means for your product

Most people talk about Dunbar's number in terms of 150, but the power lies in close-knit groups of 50. These 50 people are your advocates, your early adopters, your most vocal supporters. For product builders, focusing here first creates a foundation that grows beyond one-time use or sporadic engagement.

1. **Quality over quantity**: Building a strong network starts with a core group of advocates. These 50 people are your most engaged users, the ones who will spread the word and bring others in.
2. **Network effect**: When you focus on building a strong core group, you create a network effect that drives growth. These advocates bring in others who trust their recommendations, creating a ripple effect.
3. **Sustainable growth**: By nurturing your core 50, you create a foundation for sustainable growth. These advocates will stick with you through changes and challenges, helping you build a strong, resilient network.

My advice is to _build with your core 50 in mind_. Focus on creating a product that meets their needs, listens to their feedback, and adapts to their preferences. By doing so, you'll create a network that grows naturally, sustainably, and with trust at its core.

This is why many startups begin with a _friends and family_ launch. It's a great way to get blunt feedback from people who _care_ about you and your success, and who can be trusted to give you honest feedback.

### Applied science of Dunbar's Number: Gore Industries

Gore, the company that makes of GORE-TEX, applies Dunbar's number by limiting the size of its factories. When a team hits 150 people, they spin off a new group. Each group operates independently with its own R&D, production, and sales teams. This approach keeps teams close-knit, engaged, and highly collaborativeâ€”key to their success.


### Building on the Network Effect
Nurture Your Core 50: Focus on building meaningful relationships with your first 50 users. They are the heart of your network, and their enthusiasm will drive momentum. Treat their feedback like gold, and respond to their needs directly.
Create a Product of Substance: Deliver on your promises to these early adopters, listen actively, and adapt. A strong, attentive foundation encourages your core group to bring others in naturally.

## Now, go do the thing

**For your product:** Build with compassion and responsiveness. Turn your initial 50 users into advocates so they bring their own circle along.
