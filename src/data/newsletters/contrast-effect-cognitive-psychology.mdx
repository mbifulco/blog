# Contrast Elevates Perception

We often think the quality of our work speaks for itself, but in reality, _perception_ often plays an even bigger role.

The <dfn>contrast effect</dfn> shows how **presenting options in a particular way can dramatically change how they're viewed** - even more than the options themselves.

Here's why this matters for designers, developers, and product builders:

## Brand Perception is Reality

At [Craftwork](https://craftwork.com?utm_source=mikebifulco-com), we work hard to provide a seamless, well-branded experience for getting your home painted - in an industry where the bar for customer service is pretty low.

Cynically speaking, the _end result_ for our customers is essentially the same as what all of our competitors offer: a freshly painted home.

However, we have spent _countless_ hours refining the experience our customers have. From the moment they get in touch with us to the final brush stroke, we've designed every touchpoint to be as thoughtful, modern, and smooth as possible.

Because we've built our service with customer journey in mind, our customers _feel_ the difference when comparing our offering to other companies in their neighborhood. If you've ever tried to get a quote from a home services company, you know how frustrating the process can be.

We've worked hard to make it feel _just like it should_ - easy, transparent, and professional.

The end result? Pure magic. Our customer reviews talk about how easy it is to work with us, how professional our team was, and how much they love the final product.

The contrast between our service and _the usual experience_ is stark, and it's all because of the experience we've built.

## Job-seekers need to stand out

The Contrast Effect is also an invaluable tool for people who are struggling to stand out in the job market.

I've seen developers with resumes boasting experience at top companies like Google or Facebook, yet they struggle to get hired.

So, what ultimately helps people with their job hunt?

Adding **personality** to their resume, to stand out from the rest of the stack - everything from thoughtful design elements to memorable facts about themselves to a mission-driven portfolio of personal projects.

You'd be _shocked_ how many incredible resumes sound _identical_ to one another. By adding a little contrast, these developers were able to stand out in a sea of sameness.

This contrast from the usual templates makes their applications pop, even though their qualifications were already impressive. It's a perfect example of how [a little design can make all the difference](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter/your-resume-sucks).

## Pricing and Product Design

Another powerful use of the contrast effect is something you see all the time for SaaS products: pricing tables.

This design effectively compares three pricing options - causing the middle one to be seen as a _reasonable_ choice. This happens because it's strategically positioned between a high-end, feature-rich plan and a low-cost, bare-bones option.

Going a step further, [Comparing monthly and yearly plans](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter/use-annual-pricing-build-loyalty) can enhance this effect. Highlighting clear savings on the yearly option encourages users to choose the plan you're aiming for. The psychology of pricing is an art in itself.

Ultimately, the way something is presented often matters as much as the thing itself. Whether you're building a product, presenting yourself to employers, or structuring pricing for customers, _contrast_ can turn a good experience into a great one.
