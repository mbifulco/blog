## Trust is the hardest thing to build

In startupland, products don't fail because they're bad. They fail because nobody trusts them.

Bar none, this is the single most common reason for a failure to launch - a failure to earn the trust of the people who are supposed to use your product.

- when you see an ad, how do you tell the difference between a high quality product that's  built to last, and trash from Temu?
- when you meet someone new, how can you tell if their values and work ethic are aligned with yours?
- if you're searching for a cofounder, how can you tell if they're someone you can rely on to do meaingful work?

There are no shortcuts to earning trust. As a founder and a builder, this comes down to **signal** - how are you substantively showing the world that your product is worth using, and worth paying for?

## Listen first, then build

The first signal is simple: immerse yourself in the world of the people you want to serve. Listen to them, _empathize_ with their problems, and become an enthusiastic part of their community. 

In the earliest stages of product development, you should be listening more than anything. Ask questions, and listen to the answers, and decide on a product direction based on what you're observing, not on what you thought you knew all along.

Perhaps most importantly: becoming a regular in the places where you're building your market is how you become trusted by the community. It is _really_ difficult to just show up and start selling; you have to be a part of the community first.

## Ship early, ship ugly

Once you're building, ship often, and share updates with your target audience. Don't get hung up on perfection here -- share what's new and what's working well _as well as_ the things that aren't working.

It's okay to be wrong - and probably a good thing at this stage. Features that hit the cutting room floor are ones that you can learn from, and your customers will appreciate your honesty. 

## The big reveal is the path to failure

Let's all say it together: [Nobody wants a The Big Reveal™️](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter/nobody-wants-a-big-reveal). Keeping your work secret is a surefire way to launch a product that nobody wants to an empty room.

## Authenticity and the trust economy

You'll do best when the work you share comes from your heart - and not from a hastily written ChatGPT prompt. That's not to say that you should _never_ use LLMs to help you communicate, but your customer will be able to tell when they're being generated-at rather than spoken-to.



These signals are getting more difficult to spot; AI tools have made it easy to apear productive, successful, and wise. You've probably seen headlines recently about [Soham Parekh](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/who-is-soham-parekh-the-serial-moonlighter-silicon-valley-startups-cant-stop-hiring/), a talented engineer who has been working for multiple startups at the same time.

It takes less effort than ever for someone to _appear_ productive, successful, and visionary. Everything is getting wrapped in a glossy layer of AI-powered "productivity"; work is being churned out of LLMs at a pace that's hard to keep up with.

How do you tell the difference between someone who's actually doing meaningful work, and someone cleverly piloting LLMs at a breakneck pace? Honestly -- it's hard to say.



## Prove that your work can be trusted

The same is true for your product.
