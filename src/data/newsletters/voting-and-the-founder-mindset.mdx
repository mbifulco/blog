## The big idea

Voting isn't just about one issue or one stance - each vote is an opportunity to think broadly about what kind of world we want to build. So, vote with all your values in mind - not just one.


## Bring the Founder Mindset to the Polls

As founders, builders, and creators, we're constantly thinking about shaping the future - taking small steps each day to improve products, create solutions, and make lives better. The vision driving us is one of progress, not just for the next quarter but for the long term.

During election season, many people tend to lose sight of the bigger picture and lessons of even the recent past, often getting caught up in the emotions of the moment.

To me, it feels like a short- to medium-term memory loss, where we forget past choices and their consequences. I know a good number of people who sat out the 2016 election or voted for a third party to _send a message_ - which, well -- we all know how that turned out.

In the tech world, organizations have backed candidates based on single issues, focusing on a narrow benefit while sidestepping the bigger risks to innovation, freedom, and inclusion. That kind of trade-off may feel gratifying in the moment, but it can end up limiting the very world we're working so hard to build.

### Beyond the Trade-Offs
Voting thoughtfully means thinking like a founder: weighing short-term gains against long-term consequences. It's about balancing immediate benefits with the impact on society, rights, and industries in the years to come. A single-issue endorsement may deliver short-term support for one area, but it's rarely worth compromising on the rest of what we value.

### Vote for the World You're Building

The best companies, and the best leaders, look beyond the next quarter, just as the best voters look beyond a single issue. So this election, think beyond one policy and consider how each candidate's values and actions align with the future you want to help create.

## Most importantly: Vote

If you're elligible to vote in this election, the moral and ethical imperative is to vote. It's shaping up to be a close race, and your voice is more likely than ever to make a difference.

You're not reading this newsletter because you're an apathetic person. You're reading this newsletter because of the active role you've taken in your life, and because you care about the future. So go out there and make your voice heard.

## Resources for staying informed on elections


### An interview with Mo Green
A special shout out this week: North Carolina's election for State Superintendent of Schools has gotten a ton of attention, and for good reason. Shortly after this newsletter goes out, an in-depth [interview with Democratic candidate Mo Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN1mCjkpU-c) will be featured on the Primary Focus YouTube channel.

I'm _super duper_ biased here: not only is Mo Green a great candidate (and _the only_ serious candidate in the race), but Primary Focus is run by my favorite person in the world - who I'm lucky enough to be married to. Give the video a watch, and slap the subscribe button while you're at it.

## Check your registration status and find your polling place

If you're in the US, make a plan to vote: [vote.org](https://www.vote.org/) is a tremendous resource. You can see your registration status, find your polling place, and even see a sample ballot.

## A primer on the US election system from CGP Grey

üé• The US Election system is... frustrating, but it's the system we've got. YouTuber CGP Grey has an incredible [video series on voting](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqs5ohhass_RN57KWlJKLOc5xdD9_ktRg), which is worth a watch over your lunch break. Here's a teaser: as a result of the way our elections work, it's a mathematical inevitability that we'll end up with a two-party system. However -- there are already _some_ jurisdictions where this is changing!

That's it for me this week - I'll be back to sharing more direct wisdom about building products in the weeks to come, but rest assured: this election _is_ a big damned deal.

I wouldn't be writing this newsletter if I didn't think you had the capacity to make a difference. So go out there and vote.
