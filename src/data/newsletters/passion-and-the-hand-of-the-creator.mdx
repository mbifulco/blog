# The Big Idea

It's not divine intervention; it's just someone who did a damn good job.

## Go on, put your back into it

North Carolina summers are like being slowly baked inside a damp sock. Triple-digit heat. Humidity so thick you could bottle it and sell it as soup. It‚Äôs the kind of weather that makes you question your life choices.

But the moment you step into a perfectly air-conditioned room: one that hits you with that crisp, fresh chill on a blistering day - that is what salvation feels like. Not just relief, but a stark, physical reminder of the incredible effort that has gone into the built environment.

Now and then, I get the same feeling from software, too. When someone really puts every bit of their intellectual might into making something that feels _alive_.

### Creative works that just feel different

**[Blue Prince](https://www.blueprincegame.com/)** and **[Animal Well](https://www.animalwell.net/)** are two recent games that twist themselves into meta-puzzles, daring you to notice every pixel. I hardly play games at all nowadays, but I can feel the love in every corner of these worlds. It‚Äôs intoxicating.

**Small touches added to Android** - instant translation of any text on any screen (even from an image!), no app-switching needed. Spam calls? Silenced. Texts from bots? Blocked. It feels like magic, but it‚Äôs just good design.

[PostHog's new AI Wizard](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install?tab=wizard) - I ran a single npx command and it read my codebase, set up analytics, and configured AI suggestions like it knew exactly what was needed for Craftwork's specific architecture. That‚Äôs not a fluke - that‚Äôs care, craftsmanship, and context-awareness built into the bones.

### Now go do the damn thing

These examples are more than just little features. They‚Äôre evidence of effort, of risk, of someone pushing past ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs the work that sticks with me; because it has a **pulse**.

Recreating that sensation... the feeling of a blast of AC on a boiling day - is what I want to do with every product I work on.

**What will it take** to give your work a pulse?

## Mobile app revolution: What to do in this post-Apple ruling landscape

In the latest turn in the Epic Games v Apple legal saga, Apple is now required to allow developers to link to external payment options without imposing additional fees or restrictions. With the freedom and the complexities of taking payments for your app on the web, the real question is: what to do next?

## Links plucked from my gray matter

One of the things I like most about my job is being able to take inspiration from all over the place. These are some of the things that have stuck with me recently:

- [Unreasonable Hospitality](https://amzn.to/4idMvHZ) is The best book I've read in the past year, hands down. I liked it so much I read it twice, [wrote a newsletter about it](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter/unreasonable-hospitality-and-design), and bought copies for friends and teammates.
- The [Besties Podcast on Blue Prince](https://thebesties.substack.com/p/blue-prince-is-the-first-must-play) is what convinced me that there was something special in the source code for the game. Host Justin McElroy's quote about "feeling the hand of the creator" sold me on it. What a masterpiece.
