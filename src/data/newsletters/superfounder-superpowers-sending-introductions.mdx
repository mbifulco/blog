## The Big Idea

Building products and teams successfully relies on your ability to build meaningful relationships; making a habit of introducing interesting people to each other is a great way to seed serendipity.

## Build Meaningful Relationships

Building a network and introducing people is an important skill that takes honing. I've learned from my most successful founder friends that it's something worth doing—offering to introduce people feels great, and it occasionally pays itself back in unexpected ways.

Here are three simple ways to do it right:

### Give them a heads up

Before you connect people, shoot them both a quick message to let them know why you think they should meet. A little heads-up goes a long way in keeping things smooth and avoiding surprises. This is where the _real_ introduction happens. If it's done well, both parties will be excited to meet.

### Be quick and thoughtful

Keep your introduction emails short and actionable. Highlight why the connection makes sense and how the parties might benefit from knowing each other. A concise, well-thought-out message shows respect for everyone's time - they're rarely longer than a couple sentences.

### Trust your gut

Not every intro needs a big reason. Sometimes, just putting two cool people together can lead to amazing, unexpected stuff. Be the spark that gets things rolling—you never know what might happen.

When done right, introductions are more than just emails — they're opportunities to foster creativity, collaboration, and growth. Start small, but start today.

As a founder, your inbox is chaos—but it doesn't have to be. Superhuman cuts through the noise, prioritizes what matters, and drafts replies before you even open a message. Every action takes seconds, not minutes.

Start 2025 with clarity, focus, and 4+ hours saved every week. **Your first month is free.** What's stopping you?

### A sample introduction email

Many of the introductions I send and receive look something like this:

> Subject: Mike, meet Sarah
> Hey gang -
> Sending over a quick note to connect you. You both have context, but think it would be great for you to meet! Will let you take it from here.
> T.

Brief, informative, and to the point. It gets the job done!

## From around the internet

I've come across a great deal of creative inspiration online this week - and I thought you'd appreciate these:

[Lofted Goods](https://thangs.com/designer/LoftedGoods) is a designer who creates simple, elegant, and functional 3d prints for use around the home. Their aesthetic really speaks to me, and I love the addition of thoughtful features, like an insert for wall-hung decor that makes it dead easy to decide where to drill holes for screws and wall anchors. Best of all? You can download the files for free and print them yourself.

My god do I love a good typeface. I recently came across [Taylor Penton's hand-drawn fonts](https://www.taylorpenton.com/fonts), and fell in love straight away. I've even hopped onboard as a paying member of their Type Club. I may even incorporate some of [Taylor's webfonts on my site](https://github.com/mbifulco/blog/pull/945) before long...

## What about you, friend?

As always, I'd love to hear what you're working on. Read something interesting recently? Launching your product soon? Hit reply and let me know. I do my best to respond to each and every one.
