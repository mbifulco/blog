This is a talk I gave at [Blend Conf](http://2013.blendconf.com/speakers/mike-bifulco/) in Charlotte, NC USA in 2013, when I was working for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a UX Designer. If you're interested in learning how to design apps for a version of Windows that came out in 2012, this is your day!

Slides are [available on Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/mbifulco1/designing-windows-81-apps-from-the-ground-up)
