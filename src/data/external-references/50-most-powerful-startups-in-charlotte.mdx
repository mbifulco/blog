I was cofounder and CEO of [smpl](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smpl-llc), a SaaS startup helping independent-scale coworking operators automate their business. We were featured in a 2017 Article by Axios Charlotte (then called **The Charlotte Agenda**) as one of the most powerful (lol) startups in town. Pretty cool!
