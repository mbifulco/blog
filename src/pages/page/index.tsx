// This file exists in addition to the redirect in next.config.mjs for /page â†’ /.
// Why? The Next.js config redirect only handles the exact path at the edge, but not all cases (e.g., trailing slashes, direct navigation, or some test runners).
// Having this file ensures that any request to /page (with or without trailing slash) is handled gracefully in all environments, never returns a 404, and always redirects to the home page.
